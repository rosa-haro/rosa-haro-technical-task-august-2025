/**
 * UserSearchComponent â€” wrapper that wires the base SearchBarComponent to GitHub
 * username suggestions using the `useUserSuggestions` hook.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Manages debounced input, in-flight request cancellation, dropdown open/close,
 *   and keyboard navigation through the hook.
 * - Renders the presentational SearchBarComponent (input+form) and the 
 *   SearchSuggestionsComponent (listbox).
 * - Navigates to `/user/:username` on submit (typed value) or when selecting
 *   a suggestion.
 * 
 * Accessibility:
 * - The wrapper exposes a combobox container with `role="combobox"`,
 *   `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` pointing to the suggestions listbox.
 * - The input receives `aria-activedescendant` referencing the active option
 *   when the dropdown is open.
 * - The suggestions list is rendered with `role="listbox"` and each item as
 *   `role="option"` (handled in SearchSuggestionsComponent).
 * 
 * Keyboard behavior:
 * - Escape: closes the dropdown.
 * - ArrowUp/ArrowDown (when open): moves the active item.
 * - Enter: when open, selects the active suggestion; when closed, submits 
 *   the typed value.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - This component does not perform data fetching directly; `useUserSuggestions`
 *   owns all state and side effects.
 * - The base SearchBarComponent stays presentation-only and is reusable for
 *   repository filters (without suggestions)
